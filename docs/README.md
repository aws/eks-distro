# Writing and publishing docs

Our docs are written in [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

MkDocs is a static site generator. It converts markdown files to static html pages. Edit the markdown files, and view the rendered site with MkDocs.

## Build the docs locally

### Install mkdocs-material

ðŸŸ§ The docs require the mkdocs-material theme.

To ensure you are using a compatible version of mkdocs and the mkdocs-material theme, use a python virtual environment. Then, install mkdocs-material.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Visit the python docs to learn more about [virutal environments (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Optionally, use a global `.gitignore` to hide the `venv` directory.

### Local preview

ðŸŸ§ Test locally, including both the content and the navigation structure.

The docs are just Markdown files and in order to see the rendered preview locally (before PRing the repo), do:

```
 $ mkdocs serve

Problems with the local preview? Check the [Material for MkDocs changelog](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/upgrading/).

### Writing

The [MkDocs reference](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) includes information on the structure of the `docs/` folder, and writing in markdown.

Review the [Material for MkDocs reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/formatting/) for information on the theme and formatting.

### Publish

To publish updated docs, commit changes to the markdown files and open a pull
request. When your commits are merged, a post-submit job will automatically
build and deploy the site.

You can view the status of the post-submit on
[Prow](https://prow.eks.amazonaws.com)
