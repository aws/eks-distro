# Project governance

This document lays out the guidelines under which the 
EKS Distro (EKS-D) project will be governed. The goal 
is to make sure that the roles and responsibilities
are well-defined and clarify how decisions are made.

## Roles

In the context of EKS-D, we consider the following roles:

* __Users__ ... everyone using EKS-D, typically willing to provide
feedback on EKS-D by proposing features and/or filing issues.
* __Contributors__ ... everyone contributing code, documentation,
examples, testing infra, and participating in feature proposals as
well as design discussions.
* __Maintainers__ ... are responsible for engaging with and assisting
contributors to iterate on the contributions until it reaches acceptable
quality. Maintainers can decide whether the contributions can be accepted
into the project or rejected.

## Communication

The primary mechanism for communication will be via the `#provider-aws`
channel on the Kubernetes Slack community. All features and bug fixes will be
tracked as issues in GitHub. All decisions will be documented in GitHub issues.

In the future, we may consider using a public mailing list, which can be better
archived. 

## Release Management

The release process will be governed by AWS and will coincide with the release of EKS.

## Roadmap Planning

Maintainers will share roadmap and release versions as milestones in GitHub.
