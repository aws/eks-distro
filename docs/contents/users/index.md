## Using EKS Distro 

The best way to try out EKS Distro (EKS-D) is to use one of the Community
procedures (such as [Starting EKS-D with kubeadm](../users/install/kubeadm-onsite.md))
or [Partners](../community/partners.md) procedures to install and start an EKS-D cluster.
If you want to build EKS-D from source code, follow the instructions
in [Build Prerequisites](build-prerequisites.md) and [Build EKS-D](build.md).

## Exploring EKS Distro

Explore the EKS-D containers and source code directly, if you want to better
understand the components that make up EKS-D.

You can pull the images that make up the EKS Distro from the Public ECR Gallery.
A [pull-all.sh shell
script](https://github.com/aws/eks-distro/blob/main/development/pull-all.sh) is
provided to demonstrate how to do this. You can also browse the [EKS Distro
Container Repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/?searchTerm=eks-distro&verified=verified)
to learn about those containers. EKS-D source code is available from the [eks-distro](https://github.com/aws/eks-distro) Github repository.
