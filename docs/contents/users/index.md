## Using EKS Distro 

The best way to try out EKS Distro (EKS-D) is to use one of the
[Partners](../users/install/partners.md) procedures to install and start an EKS-D cluster.
You may also find a community-supported installation method useful. Community-supported 
installation methods are found on our
[community-supported installation page](../users/install/index.md).

## Exploring EKS Distro

Explore the EKS-D containers and source code directly if you want to better
understand the components that make up EKS-D.

You can pull the images that make up the EKS Distro from the Public ECR Gallery.
A [pull-all.sh shell
script](https://github.com/aws/eks-distro/blob/main/development/pull-all.sh) is
provided to demonstrate how to do this. You can also browse the 
[EKS Distro Container Registry](https://gallery.ecr.aws/eks-distro) to learn
about those containers. EKS-D source code is available from the
[eks-distro](https://github.com/aws/eks-distro) GitHub repository.
