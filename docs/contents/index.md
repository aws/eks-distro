# Amazon EKS Distro

Amazon **EKS Distro** (EKS-D) is a Kubernetes distribution based on and used by 
Amazon EKS to create reliable and secure Kubernetes clusters. With EKS-D,
you can rely on the same versions of Kubernetes and its dependencies deployed
by Amazon EKS. This includes the latest upstream updates as well as extended 
security patching support. EKS-D follows the same Kubernetes version release 
cycle as Amazon EKS and we provide the bits here.


Give EKS-D a spin by using one of the exemplary [install](users/index.md) 
recipes, check out how to use on of the methods [partners](community/partners.md)
have provided or [build](./users/build.md) a cluster from scratch.
