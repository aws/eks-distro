# EKS Distro Release Runbook

After the first release, the process is the same, but not all the steps need to be completed
unless there is a change.

Prow jobs are in the [eks-distro-prow-jobs repo](https://github.com/aws/eks-distro-prow-jobs/tree/main/jobs/aws/eks-distro).  
All other changes are to this package.
