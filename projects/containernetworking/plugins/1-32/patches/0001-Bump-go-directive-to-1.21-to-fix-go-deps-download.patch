Subject: [PATCH] Bump go directive for tag 1.5.1 to fix go dependency download

Description:
The upstream tag 1.5.1 specifies a go directive version of 1.20, which causes go mod vendor to fail while downloading dependencies.
To resolve this, the go directive is updated to 1.21 which has been verified after running 'go mod tidy'.
While we are using same Go version 1.22, consistent with the upstream, the upstream build uses 1.22-alpine. Our build process does not use Alpine, making this the difference in causing our build to fail.
