Subject: --EKS-PATCH-- ConsistentRead tries 10 times

Taken from commit on upstream Kubernetes:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102059/commits/82cfe9f14f8fb445d682ce2774ea44ce54885e81.
This commit is part of upstream PR
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102059, which is part
of 1.22.

From the original commit message:
    We've seen clusters where 3 attempts were not enough. Bumping to
    10. The slowdown should be negligible and it will reduce retry
    attempts in the upper layers of kubelet.
