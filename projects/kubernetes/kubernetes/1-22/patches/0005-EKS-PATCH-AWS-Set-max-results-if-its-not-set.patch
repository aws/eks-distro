Subject: --EKS-PATCH-- [AWS] Set max results if its not set

Cherry-pick of upstream Kubernetes:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106280, which is
included in Kubernetes 1.24. There was a PR opened to cherry-pick
this change for 1.22, but it was not approved before the release of
the patch version of Kubernetes EKS-Distro uses for 1.22. See
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107653

* If max results is not set and instance IDs are not provided for the
  describe instances call in the aws cloud provider, set max results.
* This prevents an expensive call against the EC2 API, which can
  result in timeouts.
