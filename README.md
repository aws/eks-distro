Amazon **EKS Distro** (EKS-D) is a Kubernetes distribution based on and used by
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to create reliable and secure Kubernetes
clusters. With EKS-D, you can rely on the same versions of Kubernetes and its
dependencies deployed by Amazon EKS. This includes the latest upstream updates,
as well as extended security patching support. EKS-D follows the same Kubernetes
version release cycle as Amazon EKS, and we provide the bits here. EKS-D offers
the same software that has enabled tens of thousands of Kubernetes clusters on
Amazon EKS.

This GitHub repository has everything required to build the components that make
up the EKS Distro from source.
