Amazon EKS Distro image for Kubernetes SIGS aws-iam-authenticator

AWS IAM Authenticator is a tool to use AWS IAM credentials to authenticate to a Kubernetes cluster. By using AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes, you avoid having to manage a separate credential for Kubernetes access. AWS IAM also provides a number of nice properties such as an out-of-band audit trail (via CloudTrail) and 2FA/MFA enforcement.
