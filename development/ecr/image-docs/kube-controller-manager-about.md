Amazon EKS Distro image for Kubernetes kube-controller-manager

The Kubernetes controller manager is a Control Plane component that runs controller processes. In Kubernetes, a controller is a control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state. Examples of controllers that ship with Kubernetes today are the replication controller, endpoints controller, namespace controller, and serviceaccounts controller.
