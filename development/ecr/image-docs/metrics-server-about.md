Amazon EKS Distro image for Kubernetes metrics-server

The Kubernetes Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines. It collects resource metrics from kubelets and exposes them in Kubernetes apiserver through Metrics API for use by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (CPU/Memory based autoscaling) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (automatically adjusting/suggesting resources needed by containers).
